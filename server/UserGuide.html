<h1><a id="1_Overview_0"></a>1. Overview</h1>
<p>This document contains the User Guide for Planning Visualiser.</p>
<p>The Planning Visualiser is an open-source program which visualises solutions to Planning Problems. It is an executable Unity architecture in a browser.</p>
<h2><a id="11_Planning_Problems_7"></a>1.1 Planning Problems</h2>
<p>For information about Planning Problems, see <a href="http://planning.domains/">http://planning.domains/</a></p>
<p>Our application uses one ‘Animation Profile’ per problem domain. An Animation Profile is a user-written PDDL file which tells the Visualiser how a Domain is to be visualised. See the developer docs for more information.</p>
<h2><a id="12_Scope_15"></a>1.2 Scope</h2>
<p>Planning Visualiser currently has Animation Profiles for four problem domains; Blocks, Grid, Towers of Hanoi, and Logistics. Other simple problem domains may be added by writing an Animation Profile (see section 3.2).</p>
<p>Planning visualiser can generate a solution using the solver on <a href="http://planning.domains/">http://planning.domains/</a> . Alternatively, the user can provide their own solution from any solver, provided it conforms to the correct format.</p>
<h1><a id="2_Using_the_system_23"></a>2. Using the system</h1>
<h2><a id="21_Visualise_Builtin_Domains_26"></a>2.1 Visualise Built-in Domains</h2>
<h3><a id="211_Select_Files_28"></a>2.1.1 Select Files</h3>
From the home screen, two options are available:
<ol>
<li> <i> Build visualisation from Problem </i> </li>
	<ul> 
		<li> Choose this option to generate a visualisation for a given problem</li>
		<li> Requires the following files: Domain PDDL, Problem PDDL, Animation Profile PPDL. <b>Files for existing domains are located in the bitbucket repository under Test/Sample Files.</b></li>
		<li> A custom URL can be chosen to connect to any solver. The default is solver.planning.domains </li>
	</ul>
<li> <i> Build visualisation from Solution VFG </i> </li>
<ul> 
		<li> Choose this option to view the visualisation for an existing Visalisation file</li>
		<li> Reuqires the following file: Visualisation File</li>
		<li> This allows the user to generate a visualisation file once, and watch it multile times or share it with others</li>
	</ul>

</ol>
Once the correct files are uplodaded, the user will be taken to the Visualiser screen.

<h3><a id="212_Visualise_Solution_33"></a>2.1.2 Visualise Solution</h3>
<p>The visualisation page has several parts.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Steps Panel:</b> Shows all the steps in the solution. Steps can be clicked to navigate the animation to that step.</li>
<li><b>Step Information Panel:</b> shows detailed information for each step, including actions.</li>
<li><b>Animation Panel:</b> displays the animation. Objects in the domain are darkened when they are part of a satisfied subgoal.</li>
<li><b>Control Panel:</b> buttons to control the animation. These include changing the speed of the animation, Play/Pause, Step Forward/Backwards, Replay</li>
<li><b>Subgoal panel:</b> Shows all subgoals (predicates which comprise the goal state). Subgoals change colour when they are satisfied. Clicking on the subgoal opens a dropdown list to all of the steps in which the subgoal is satisfied.</li>
<li><b>Header Bar:</b> Contains Home button, Help button, and a button to download the Visualisation file. This downloaded visualisation file can be shared with others or re-watched.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a id="22_Visualise_a_new_Domain_42"></a>2.2 Visualise a new Domain</h2>
<p>This can be done, for many simple domains, with no modification to the system.</p>
<p>To add a new domain:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write or obtain a Domain PDDL file for the problem domain. Many domains can be found at <a href="https://bitbucket.org/planning-researchers/classical-domains/src/208a850d2ff2a27068329ad578ad99af9ec7e5c5/classical/?at=master">https://bitbucket.org/planning-researchers/classical-domains/src/208a850d2ff2a27068329ad578ad99af9ec7e5c5/classical/?at=master</a></li>
<li>Write an Animation Profile which corresponds to the domain file. For documentation on the Animation Profile Language, see the file ‘Animation Profile Language’</li>
<li>Follow the steps in 2.1 to view a visualisation with the new Animation Profile.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a id="23_Video_Record_a_Visualisation_52"></a>2.3 Video Record a Visualisation</h2>
<p>A video recording of the visualisation can be created so that the final animation can be easily shared or re-reviewed independently of the system. The below recommendations are one way of recording the animation, however many other methods and tools exist to achieve this.</p>
<h3><a id="231_MacOS_Users_57"></a>2.3.1 MacOS Users</h3>
<p>To video record the visualisation, have the animation you wish to record on your screen, then complete the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch the pre-installed QuickTime Player application</li>
<li>Select “File” and choose “New Screen Recording”</li>
<li>To decide whether mouse clicks and sounds appear in your recording or not, click the small, white arrow and select the appropriate options from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>When ready, click the red record button.</li>
<li>You will need to select what you want to record. To record the entire screen, click once anywhere. To record only a portion of it, click and drag a box and then click “Start Recording.”</li>
<li>When finished, navigate to the menu bar and click the stop recording button designated by the square symbol.</li>
<li>To save your recording, click “File” and then&quot;Save&quot;, and choose an appropriate save location and name for the recording.</li>
<li>View and share file as you would with any other media file.</li>
</ol>

</ul>
<h3><a id="232_Windows_Users_74"></a>2.3.2 Windows Users</h3>
<p>To video record the visualisation, have the animation you wish to record on your screen, then complete the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the Windows key and the letter G at the same time to open the Game Bar dialog (this will pop up on your screen).</li>
<li>Check the “Yes, this is a game” checkbox to load the Game Bar. This is the procedure regardless of what you are recording.</li>
<li>Click on the Start Recording button, or press Win + Alt + R to start screen recording.</li>
<li>Stop the recording by clicking on the red recording button on the pop-up.</li>
<li>The video can be accessed via your Videos folder, inside the Captures folder.</li>
</ol>

<h1><a id="3_Extending_the_system_89"></a>3. Extending the system</h1>
<p>Planning Visualiser is modular and can be extended in multiple ways.</p>
<p>Many simple domains can be captured in the existing Animation Profile language. For more complex domains, modifications may need to be made to the application.</p>
<p>Detailed developer documentation is available at the project's repository (under /Docs) .</p>
